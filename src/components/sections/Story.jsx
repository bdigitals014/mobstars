      <Tagline>There is a story behind every scar and so was the case with Dexter, Rio, Wolfan, Stone, Theo and Fierreman. Five were orphans, their parents died of different circumstances and each grew up in different slums in the Continental city, denied access to learning or a good life like others and they were grossly undermined and bullied by the rich kids. Survival was a hard thing to do and they merely held on to their worn-out shirts even as the freezing nights threatened to take them off. As they grew, they came together and decided to form a brotherhood. Along the line, Theo joined in, though he was a wealthy kid but he was dissatisfied in the operations of those in power. They found out how the funds that ought to have been used to develop their homes had been directed into the personal pockets of the Mayor of Continental city and his cohorts. This tore through their hearts like lead.</Tagline>
